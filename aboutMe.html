      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Originally from Portugal, I now reside in Switzerland, having attained a Bachelor's degree in Economics. My professional experience is informed by a strategic and analytical approach to decision-making.</p>
      <p>My interests, however, extend far beyond the world of economics. I am an avid climber and alpinist, constantly challenging myself to conquer the most demanding of peaks. The thrill of the ascent is a feeling unlike any other.</p>  
      <p>In addition to my passion for climbing, I am also deeply interested in the world of technology. Whether learning about the latest advancements in the field, or tinkering with cutting-edge gadgets, I am always eager to remain at the forefront of innovation.</p>  
      <p>The intersection of adventure and technology is where I find myself most at home. I am constantly searching for new ways to push myself to new limits, both in the mountains and beyond. Whether ascending a daunting peak, or embarking on a new project, I embrace every challenge with enthusiasm and determination.</p>
